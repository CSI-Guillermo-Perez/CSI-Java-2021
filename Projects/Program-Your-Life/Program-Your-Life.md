# Program your Life `(âˆžpts)`

  * With a main.

### [Determine your life expectancy based on your geolocation.](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/PRI/puerto-rico/life-expectancy#:~:text=The%20current%20life%20expectancy%20for,a%200.21%25%20increase%20from%202018.)    
* Create a `integer` variable called `lifeExpectancy` and assign it this value.   
* [Reduce it by 10 years if you expect to smoke during your lifetime.](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/tobacco_related_mortality/index.htm)

### Create a for loop that runs this many times.
* Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming.

* It should look like:
```java
for(int age = 0; age < lifeExpectancy; i++){

}
