## Calculate your expenses
### Start of life
* During your formative years you may have had a job or christmas gifts. I hope you've been saving up!
  * Create these `double` variables **outside of your for loop**. They may all be `0.0` for this exercise.
    * startingAmount
    * cash
    * debt
    * invested
  * Sum your starting amount to your cash.
```java
double cash = 0.0;
double startingAmount = 1_000;
cash += startingAmount;
```
  * Create variables inside your formative years. 
    * salary
  * Sum the variables you've created in your formative years, to the ones created outside of your loop.
```java
// Formative years
if(age < 18){
        double salary = 0;
        cash += salary;
} 
```
